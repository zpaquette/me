### Personal Read.me

Welcome to my Read.me! I am excited to get to know you and work with you. I expect it will take some time before everyone is fully comfortable with one another and I hope this document will aid in that effort. This is in no way a fully comprehensive document of everything I am but it's a good place to start.

# Who am I?

### Non Work

Outside of work I am a man of many hobbies and interests. Everything from woodworking to recording music to playing a round of golf. I enjoy keeping busy and building things. I am married and have one dog, Max who is my best buddy, and two cats Gus and Arwen. Mental health is a very important topic in my life and I truly like to try to balance work and life.

### Work

In the office, I am a highly dedicated and excitable person. I love working on projects, building features, and learning new and better ways of doing things. Testing new ideas and brainstorming are two of my loves. I am always open to help, giving sanity checks, and talking over new ideas.

I have two philosophies that guide me while at work. The first is “I’ve done this before, so I’m sure I can”. Sometimes the best thing to do is just jump in and try something new. You’re going to learn something no matter what the outcome. The second is F.A.I.L. First Attempt In Learning. At some point, something is not going to go as expected. That’s ok. It took me a long time to learn that. Fail fast and pivot to the next idea!

# Communication 

Each form of modern communication has its time and place. That being said, my least favorite form of communication is email. If we are at work and you need me I am always open to a face-to-face conversation or a slack. If I have my headphones on I am usually in dungeon mode and would appreciate a slack to let me know you need my attention. 

You can feel free to text me at any time and I will always do my best to get back to you quickly. My number is (317)-801-1400. 

I do best when given information straight up. Depending on what we are talking about it may take me a few moments to process what I have been told and to respond. I am also a very excitable person. It is 100% acceptable to tell me to calm it down a bit or lower my voice. I won’t take offense.

I also grew up with two younger sisters and a brother. My house was always very busy and loud. I developed a “superpower” where I can tune out almost everything around me if I want to. If you try to get my attention and I don’t respond I am not ignoring you. Just give me a little tap on the shoulder or on my desk to grab my attention.

# What I Value

**Respect** -This is something that I value and that I believe everyone deserves. If you ever feel I have not shown you the respect you deserve, first know that I am sorry and second please let me know so we can address it. 

**Curiosity** - I am a very curious person. I love to learn and try new things. I love questions and like asking questions. I believe there can sometimes be a stigma attached to questions but I don't pay attention to it. “He who asks a question may be perceived as a fool for a moment but he who never asks a question will be a fool for their lifetime.”

**Dedication** - I am in it to win it! I am a very dedicated person both in my personal life and my work life. I will put in the hours, blood, sweat, and tears. I love to celebrate wins as a team and look back fondly at the work we put in to get there.

**Honesty** - Nothing breaks down a team or a relationship like a lie.
